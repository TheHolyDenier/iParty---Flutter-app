If you've created links BETWEEN different prototypes, make sure that you unzip the files so that the various project-name folders are all in the same parent folder, like this:

my prototypes
	prototype 1
		(HTML and PNG files for this prototype)
	prototype 2
		(HTML and PNG files for this prototype)


More details:

Suppose you have prototypes named "prototype 1" and "prototype 2".

When you generate HTML for each of these, you'll get two zip files, each with a timestamp on it, similar to this:
	prototype 1 - 2015-11-24  8.22PM.zip
	prototype 2 - 2015-11-22  7.12AM.zip

When you unzip these files, each will give you a folder named after the project (but without the timestamp), like this:
	prototype 1
	prototype 2

For cross-prototype links to work, these two project-name folders should live in the same parent folder. (It doesn't matter what you name the parent folder.)

For example, if you've created a "my prototypes" folder to hold all your generated prototypes, the file structure should look like the example given at the top of this file.
